Here are examples of recently reported DSA questions and coding patterns to focus on:
Recently Reported DSA/Coding Questions

* Large File String Search (Machine Coding/Algorithmic):
* Problem: Find an input string in a file that is too large to fit in memory. You are given an API to access the file character by character (char getChar();).
* This tests your understanding of memory-efficient algorithms and streaming data processing (e.g., using a rolling hash or a fixed-size window/buffer).

* Array Manipulation Operations:
* Problem: Given an array, implement functions to perform basic add, remove, and update operations efficiently and return the resulting array.
* This focuses on time complexity for basic data structure operations.
* Concurrency/Optimization Problem:
* Problem: Given a database scenario where it acquires a write lock every 15 minutes and is read-heavy (acquiring a read lock every 30 seconds), how would you optimize the locking mechanism?
* This question blends DSA concepts with real-world concurrency and database knowledge, which is common for senior roles.

Common DSA Topics and LeetCode Patterns
Candidates consistently report that DocuSign's coding rounds assess proficiency across core DSA areas, often matching medium-difficulty LeetCode questions. You should prepare extensively on:
 * Arrays and Strings:
   * Two Sum
   * Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
 * Linked Lists:
   * Reverse a Linked List
   * Merge Two Sorted Lists
 * Trees and Graphs:
   * Binary Tree Inorder Traversal
   * Number of Islands (BFS/DFS)
 * Sorting and Searching:
   * Merge Intervals
   * Search in Rotated Sorted Array
 * Dynamic Programming (DP):
   * Climbing Stairs
   * Longest Increasing Subsequence
 * Hash Tables:
   * Group Anagrams
   * Top K Frequent Elements

Senior Level System Design Topics

While you specifically asked for DSA, note that for a Senior Software Engineer role, System Design is a critical technical round. You must be prepared to design scalable systems. Common topics include:

 * Design a Rate Limiter for a microservices API.
 * Design a system for managing a Distributed Search Engine.
 * Design a social network's Friend Recommendation System.
 * Design a URL Shortener.
 * Design a Notification System for an application.



 System Design Topic,Key DSA/Concepts to Discuss
Secure Digital Signature System,"Hashing (SHA-256/3), Checksums, Asymmetric Cryptography"
Document/File Management,"Trie (for auto-complete/search), B-Trees (for database indexing)"
Real-time Communication (like chat/messaging),"Graph traversal (friend graph), Priority Queues (for message delivery)"
Load Balancing,Consistent Hashing (for distributed caching)


That's a great question. As a **Senior Software Engineer** candidate for DocuSign in Bengaluru, your focus must be equally split between complex DSA patterns and large-scale **System Design**.

Based on recent interview experiences, here is a consolidated list of must-do DSA topics and representative LeetCode questions, along with the required System Design focus.

---

## 1. Core Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)

DocuSign coding rounds often feature Medium to Hard problems that test proficiency in core data structures and algorithmic patterns.



### D. Designing Data Structures
For a Senior role, you may be asked to implement a custom data structure or utilize advanced ones.
* **Design an LRU Cache (LeetCode #146):** Must implement using a **Doubly Linked List** and a **Hash Map** for $\mathcal{O}(1)$ performance.
* **Insert Delete GetRandom O(1) (LeetCode #380):** Requires combining a `HashMap` and an `Array` for average $\mathcal{O}(1)$ operations.
* **Implement Trie (Prefix Tree) (LeetCode #208):** Essential for string/prefix related applications.

## 2. System Design Focus (Senior Level) 🛠️

For a Senior role, one or two rounds will be dedicated to **System Design (HLD/LLD)**. Your Bangalore-based interview will heavily focus on **scalability, availability, and resilience**.

### A. Core Scalability Topics
* **Design a Rate Limiter** (Global/Distributed): Discuss algorithms (token bucket, leaky bucket) and implementation using Redis/Distributed Caching.
* **Design a URL Shortener:** Focus on hashing, collision resolution, and database selection (NoSQL vs. SQL).
* **Design a File Storage/Document Management System:** Highly relevant to DocuSign's business. Discuss sharding, replication, and Content Delivery Networks (CDNs).
* **Design a Notification System:** Focus on push services, message queues (Kafka/RabbitMQ), and different delivery models.

### B. DocuSign-Relevant Topics
While not exact DSA questions, be prepared to discuss the **Data Structures/Algorithms** used to support these systems.

| System Design Topic | Key DSA/Concepts to Discuss |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Secure Digital Signature System** | **Hashing** (SHA-256/3), **Checksums**, Asymmetric **Cryptography** |
| **Document/File Management** | **Trie** (for auto-complete/search), **B-Trees** (for database indexing) |
| **Real-time Communication** (like chat/messaging) | **Graph** traversal (friend graph), **Priority Queues** (for message delivery) |
| **Load Balancing** | **Consistent Hashing** (for distributed caching) |

### 🔑 Final Preparation Strategy for Senior Candidates

1.  **Solve by Pattern:** Don't just solve the 50 questions—master the core patterns (Sliding Window, Two Pointers, Top K/Heap, BFS/DFS, DP).
2.  **Trade-offs & Complexity:** For every problem, clearly articulate the **Time and Space Complexity** ($\mathcal{O}$ notation) and discuss alternative approaches and their trade-offs.
3.  **Code Quality:** Write production-ready, clean, and modular code. Since you're a Senior candidate, code quality and bug-free implementation under pressure are paramount.
